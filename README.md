## 🔑 API Configuration

FrameFinder uses [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch movie and TV show data. To run this project, you'll need to obtain an API key from TMDb.

1. Visit [The Movie Database website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create an account if you don't have one.
2. Go to your account settings and navigate to the API section.
3. Request an API key for developer use.
4. Once you have your API key, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
5. Add your API key to the `.env` file like this:
   
Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual TMDb API key.

⚠️ Important: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
